"""Start by creating a variable called grade and give it a value between 
0-100.

Write a if/else statement for the following:

If grade is greater than or equal to 55, then print "You passed."
Else, print "You failed."
After you run the code, change grade's value and rerun it. Do this a few 
times to make sure it's working as intended.
