"""The Magic 8 Ball is a popular office toy and children's toy invented in the 1940s for fortune-telling and advice seeking. ðŸŽ±

It's an oversized 8 ball with some of the following answers:

Yes - definitely.
It is decidedly so.
Without a doubt.
Reply hazy, try again.
Ask again later.
Better not tell you now.
My sources say no.
Outlook not so good.
Very doubtful.

Create a magic8.py program that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer each time it executes.

For example:
Question:      Is CodÃ©dex better than Udemy yet?
Magic 8 Ball:  Better not tell you now.
